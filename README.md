# Abalone-Elastic-Net-Regression
Finding the RMSLE on the Abalone data set by building an Elastic Net model that combines Ridge regression and Lasso Regression.
I wnated to comapre the RMSLE to that obtained with linera regression, Random Forest, XG Boost, and HG Boost after hypertuning.
Elastic net though a regularized regression gives the worst Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) to date in  comparison to the aforementioned methods.
This work has been submitted to Kaggle as a late submission.
